I went with Leeds United colors, made a small change in the blue color, and made it more navy so I got a better contrast.

## Fixed Bugs ##
----
- Had lots of bugs with the timer, it didn't stop when you clicked an answer, and it didn't reset when you clicked the next question.   
Have to thank Martin from the code institute for helping me solve it with a new improved code for the timer.   

- One last obstacle was that the quiz didnt read the first question correct, gave the right question but looked at the wrong answer. Took some time using console.log and talking to the tutor Josh to figue out that it was the questionNumber that had to be changed.

- Had a bug where you could still click an answer after you already selected yours, solved with classList disabled.

- Everytime the page loaded is showed an error regarding favicon 404, solved it by finding a post on stackoverflow, link in credit section.

- Had problem with the background on mobile, added a specific background image just for mobile to solve it.
